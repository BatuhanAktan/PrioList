# PrioList

PrioList is a chrome web extension that allows users to create a Wishlist with the press of a button. PrioList has an algorithm that allows this Wishlist to be organized in the order of importance, where necessities like food, shelter, health come in first place, wants are put behind, thus allowing people to easily prioritize their list.

### Getting Started

We created this project because money is a great part of our life and especially in a time like a pandemic it is very difficult for individuals to prioritize, which is why we wanted to solve this problem.

### Prerequisites

We used puppeteer and browserify for this project. They can be installed using the command:

```
npm install puppeteer
```

### Installing

The extension is waiting to be approved to be published on Google Web Store.

```
Link will be placed.
```

## Technologies Used

In this project we used HTML, CSS and JS. We used basic and simplistic HTML/Css keep the small extension space from crowding up and used JS for the back-end algorithms.

### Challenges

We had plenty of trouble integrating puppeteer into our browser extension since puppeteer-web is no longer available, but at the end we were able to bundle it into a package using browserify. Furthermore, it was quite challenging to develop in a language We are not familiar with, however, we believe that this was very beneficial to our understanding and knowledge of web development.


### Conclusion

To conclude, our project was quite a challenge to put together, but in the end we were able to create an application that functions as intended.
